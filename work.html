                    <h2>ME</h2>
                    <p>I've always enjoyed deep, heart-zone conversations. Since I was young, I often wondered why people opened up so easily with me. I saw that perhaps I had a gift for asking the right questions, for making people feel safe and for listening for not just what was said, but also what was left unsaid. 1 began to see that everyone, without exception, yearned to be heard, held and understood.<br>
                        These were some of the reasons that made me step into the world of coaching.<br>
                       
                        Coaching conversations are powerful. They go deep. They get to the heart of the matter. They are bold. They can be transformative. And they can leave you feeling heard and held in way that you
                        may never have experienced before<br>
                        I'm an ICF certified coach, having graduated from the Coaching For Transformation program in
                        New York in 2016. Prior to that I did my Masters in Organization Studies from the Warwick Business School (2008). I started my coaching practice working with 12 Harvard Business School students and grew from there. Session after session brought up these realizations.<br>
                        Not everything is as it seems.<br>
                        We are all dying to be heard<br>
                        Many of us struggle with feelings of guilt, shame, and not being good enough<br>
                        We often have no one to share with about the places where we are most vulnerable<br>
                        We often wear masks. Because inside we are terrified of not being loved and accepted just as we are.<br>
                        1 now live in San Francisco, and have clients in San Francisco, New York, and New Delhi. I coach both in-person and over Skype. Apart from my work as a coach, I've also been a professional photographer for many years, with a passion for helping people see the extraordinary beauty in their seemingly ordinary every day lives.

                    <h3><strong>Our relationships improve or deteriorate, one conversation at a time.</strong></h3>
                    <p>Different from therapy, Coaching involves a series of powerful conversations, that help you move forward towards your most cherished goals and, session by session, help you overcome the obstacles that stand in the way.<br>
                        We all have a default future. Coaching helps you design, and walk towards the future you truly desire.<br>
                        A coach will hear you, cheer you, challenge you. And fiercely care for you<br>
                        A coach does not advise. A coach helps draw your own best answers out of you, using the skills of deep listening, empowering questions, careful observation, brainstorming, insight and intuition. A coach will hold you accountable to your dreams.<br>
                       <h4><strong>How it works</strong></h4> 
                        Join me for a six-session package (followed by a review and recommitment if need be). This approach gives you the opportunity to reflect, take action steps and review progress each week. It is ideal for clients who don't have an urgent issue but want clarity and movement in the stuck areas of their life<br>
                        Or, a one day coaching intensive- here we spend an entire day in powerful conversations. We identify your goals, work with blocks and create a concrete action plan. Expect to feel immensely inspired by the end of the day. The intensive is especially useful for clients who come with pressing and urgent issues. This includes two follow-up conversations to keep the momentum going</p>

                  <h3><strong>LifeSkills Workshops for Students</strong></h3>
                  <p>In addition to my work as a personal coach, I have also designed and facilitated short workshops for students and young adults introducing them to concepts like non-violent communication, self-esteem, handling peer pressure, creative problem solving as well as other life skills. These workshops have received an overwhelming response.<br>
                    Each session is designed to leave concrete tools in the hands of students that they can apply immediately to their lives.<br>
                    I created these sessions because I never learnt these life skills when I was young. And how I wished I had. When I became a parent in 2018, these questions became more urgent: How do I teach my child values? How do I teach him good relationship building skills ? How do
                    1 help build his character (not just his personality)? How do I fill him up with high self-esteem? How do I make him more sensitive to larger world issues rather than lead a self-absorbed life?<br>
                    When I shared this content with students and parents, I got so much interest and requests for more and more sessions, that I felt I had touched on a nerve. It would mean a lot if the tools I offer can help some young person stand strong and happy no matter what life throws at them.</p>
