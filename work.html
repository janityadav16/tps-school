                    <p>I've always enjoyed deep, heart-zone conversations. Since I was young, I often wondered why people opened up so easily with me. I saw that perhaps I had a gift for asking the right questions, for making people feel safe and for listening for not just what was said, but also what was left unsaid. 1 began to see that everyone, without exception, yearned to be heard, held and understood.<br>
                        These were some of the reasons that made me step into the world of coaching.<br>
                       
                        Coaching conversations are powerful. They go deep. They get to the heart of the matter. They are bold. They can be transformative. And they can leave you feeling heard and held in way that you
                        may never have experienced before<br>
                        I'm an ICF certified coach, having graduated from the Coaching For Transformation program in
                        New York in 2016. Prior to that I did my Masters in Organization Studies from the Warwick Business School (2008). I started my coaching practice working with 12 Harvard Business School students and grew from there. Session after session brought up these realizations.<br>
                        Not everything is as it seems.<br>
                        We are all dying to be heard<br>
                        Many of us struggle with feelings of guilt, shame, and not being good enough<br>
                        We often have no one to share with about the places where we are most vulnerable<br>
                        We often wear masks. Because inside we are terrified of not being loved and accepted just as we are.<br>
                        1 now live in San Francisco, and have clients in San Francisco, New York, and New Delhi. I coach both in-person and over Skype. Apart from my work as a coach, I've also been a professional photographer for many years, with a passion for helping people see the extraordinary beauty in their seemingly ordinary every day lives.
